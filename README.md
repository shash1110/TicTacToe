# Tic Tac Toe Game in Java

This is a simple command-line Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If all spaces are filled without any player achieving three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
